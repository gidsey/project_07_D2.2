pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  
```bash
 python manage.py migrate
```

```bash
 python manage.py runserver
```


## Requirments
The project has been updated to run on Django 2.24. 
See `requirements.txt` for full details of the updated project dependencies.


## Styling
The project uses Bootstrap 4 for form and presentation styling.


## Tests
The project includes unit tests which cover:

* Anonymous users access denied to restriced areas
* User creation
* Template usage for all URLs
* Chamge Password form
* Profile form

These tests can be found in `tests.py`.


## Known issues

The jQuery password strength meter does not validate the password to the same standard as the 
server-side form validation. As a result a password marked as 'Strong' by the password strength
meter can still fail the strict form vaildation.
